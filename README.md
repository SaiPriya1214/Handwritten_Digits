# Handwritten_Digits
In this Project we will classify handwritten digits using a simple neural network which has only input and output layers. We will than add a hidden layer and see how the performance of the model improves.

MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a popular dataset used for handwritten digit classification. The dataset consists of a collection of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify the digits from 0 to 9 based on these images.
